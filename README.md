# **WELCOME TO MY MARKDOWN WORLD!**:

	This folder houses all things markdown. Through varying topics and subjects I will attempt to perfect my 
knowledge of the *markup language*, now these topics or discourse range from sports to anything that piques my interest (well except for *politics*, too sensitive of a topic nowadays and I never really liked ~~_politicians_~~ anyway, that 
besides the point). The information here provided will be a culmination of facts and personal opinions, so if I say 
*Brigerton* is the worst show of all time do not come at me. In all, it is a fun folder where we get to exercise our 
comprehensive abilities and improve our skill with markdown. Files in the folder include;

- master\_mind.md
- music\_fave.md
- fav\_quotes.md
- football.md
- nba.md
- tennis.md
- practise.md

	The ultimate goal for is to turn this in the nearest future into a repository where people can contribute some 
fun stuff while getting excellent with their markdown skills. A reservoir of information, like a playground for 
building for learning to build nuclear arsenal, may be too extreme of an example but the only one I can think of at 
the moment. A brief description of what each file is really all about is provided below;
