The NBA, an acronym for National Basketball Association, is the major professional basketball league in the USA. 
The league is divided into **Western** and **Eastern** conference, with thirty(*30*) teams- fifteen(*15*) in the
*western conference* and fifteen(*15*) in the *eastern conference*.


And there is the _regular season_ where each team gets to play eighty-two(_82_) games battling both teams within
and outside their conference for the top eight(*8*) seeds in their respective conferences.The top seeds get to 
feature in the play-offs, which consists of three(*3*) rounds (The first round, semi-finals and conference finals). 
The penultimate stage is the finals, featuring a team from the eastern and western conference. Each stage of the 
play-offs is a best of *'7'*, that is, a seven game series to decide the winner, and the winner of the finals is 
crowned **NBA CHAMPION**.

Apart from the **_Larry 'O Brien_** trophy awarded in the finals to the victorious team, the **NBA** also awards 
the following individual trophies, listed are the ones with the most prestige:

+ Most Valuable Player(**_MVP_**), a regular season award, presently referred to as the **Michael Jordan** trophy 
+ Defensive Player of the Year(__*DPOY*__), now known as the **Hakeem Olajuwon** trophy, also a regular season award
+ Rookie of the year, a regular season award
+ Finals Most valuable Player, the **Bill Russell** trophy, a play-off award given to the best player in the finals
series.
