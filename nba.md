The NBA, an acronym for National Basketball Association, is the major professional basketball league in the USA. 
The league is divided into **Western** and **Eastern** conference, with thirty(*30*) teams- fifteen(*15*) in the
*western conference* and fifteen(*15*) in the *eastern conference*.


And there is the _regular season_ where each team gets to play eighty-two(_82_) games battling both teams within
and outside their conference for the top eight(*8*) seeds in their respective conferences.The top seeds get to 
feature in the [*playoffs*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs), which consists of three(*3*) rounds 
(The first round, semi-finals and conference finals). 

The penultimate stage is the finals, featuring a team from the eastern and western conference. Each stage of the 
play-offs is a best of *'7'*, that is, a seven game series to decide the winner, and the winner of the finals is 
crowned **NBA CHAMPION**. Aside the **[_Larry 'O Brien Trophy_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_O%27Brien_Championship_Trophy)** 
awarded in the finals to the victorious team, the **NBA** also awards the following individual trophies, 
listed are the ones with the most prestige:
